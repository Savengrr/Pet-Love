# Pet-Love
This is the README for a project called Pet-Love.

The project is designed around getting pets together to form bonds, friendships, and, more importantly, love with eachother.

Being pet owners we have noticed how difficult it is to get our pets together so that they can experience the the compaignship and sweet sweet love making when they are cooped up in the house.  Plus, since there is no real way to get in contact with other pet owners to know when and where they will be with their pet, it has left our pets sad and lonely.  

Well this project will change that.

In our web site you will be able to:
  - Create a profile for you pet with picture, breed, location, and so on
  - Converse with the other pet owners
  - Create events so that a large group of pet owners and hang out 
  
There will also be limited times where the site will implement certain concepts from class teachings, this file will mention them below when they apply.
  
  
 -Using concepts of deferreds and promises within java in (Update with file).
